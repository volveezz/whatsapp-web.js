## About

**A WhatsApp API client that connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app**

The library works by launching the WhatsApp Web browser application and managing it using Puppeteer to create an instance of WhatsApp Web, thereby mitigating the risk of being blocked. The WhatsApp API client connects through the WhatsApp Web browser app, accessing its internal functions. This grants you access to nearly all the features available on WhatsApp Web, enabling dynamic handling similar to any other Node.js application.

> [!IMPORTANT] > **It is not guaranteed you will not be blocked by using this method. WhatsApp does not allow bots or unofficial clients on their platform, so this shouldn't be considered totally safe.**

# Link Preview Image Extraction

This repository contains enhancements to the WhatsApp Web.js library to reliably extract link preview thumbnails from messages, particularly for the `message_create` event.

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced Message Model**: Modified `getMessageModel` in `src/util/Injected/Utils.js` to capture link preview data including thumbnail URLs when available.

2. **New Helper Methods**:

    - Added `getLinkPreview()` method to Message class to extract link preview data
    - Added `downloadLinkPreviewThumbnail()` method to download thumbnails as MessageMedia objects
    - Added `window.WWebJS.downloadLinkPreviewThumbnail()` utility function

3. **Documentation**: Added comprehensive documentation in `docs/README.md` explaining the new functionality.

## Usage Example

```javascript
// Extract link preview data from any message
client.on("message_create", async (msg) => {
    const linkPreview = msg.getLinkPreview();

    if (linkPreview && linkPreview.thumbnailUrl) {
        console.log(`Found thumbnail URL: ${linkPreview.thumbnailUrl}`);

        // Download the thumbnail
        const thumbnail = await msg.downloadLinkPreviewThumbnail();
        if (thumbnail) {
            // You can send this thumbnail to another chat
            const chat = await msg.getChat();
            chat.sendMessage(thumbnail, { caption: "Link thumbnail" });

            // Or save it to a file
            thumbnail.toFilePath(`./link-thumbnail-${Date.now()}.jpg`);
        }
    }
});
```

## Why This Works

The solution captures link preview data directly from the internal WhatsApp Web message object by enhancing the serialization process in `getMessageModel`. This ensures that all link preview data, including thumbnail URLs, is reliably captured and accessible through the client API.

The implementation works for both incoming messages and messages sent by the user (captured through the `message_create` event).
